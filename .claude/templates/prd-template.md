### 1. Problem Statement
*What specific user problem are we solving with this Epic? Why is it painful for them? Use data, quotes, or support tickets to illustrate the problem.*

### 2. Business Goal & Initiative Alignment
*How does solving this problem help the business? State which company-level Initiative or OKR this Epic directly supports (e.g., "Supports the Q3 Initiative to Improve User Retention").*

### 3. Success Metrics
*How will we know we have succeeded? These should be specific, measurable, and have a target.*

| Metric                  | Current Benchmark | Target Goal       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| *e.g., CSAT Score (for this area)*   | *7.5/10*            | *> 8.5/10*        |
| *e.g., Time to Complete Task X*| *90 seconds*        | *< 30 seconds*    |
| *e.g., # of related Support Tickets*| *50/month*          | *< 10/month*      |

### 4. User Stories & Requirements
*Who is this for and what do they need to be able to do?*

**4.1. Story: [e.g., "View Users and Roles"]**
*   **Description:** "As an Admin, I want to see a list of all users and their current roles so that I can quickly understand the current state of permissions."
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] The page must load a paginated list of all users.
    *   [ ] Each row must display the user's name, email, and current role.
    *   [ ] A search bar must be present to filter the list by name or email.

**4.2. Story: [e.g., "Change a User's Role"]**
*   **Description:** "As an Admin, I want to be able to change a user's role so that I can grant or revoke privileges as needed."
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   [ ] Clicking on a user's role should present a dropdown of available roles.
    *   [ ] Selecting a new role and saving should update the user's permissions.
    *   [ ] A confirmation toast/message "User role updated successfully" must be displayed.

### 5. Scope & Constraints

**5.1. In Scope**
*A high-level summary of the features and functionality that will be delivered.*
*   A new page for viewing and filtering users.
*   Ability to edit a user's role from a predefined list.
*   ...

**5.2. Out of Scope (Non-Goals)**
*What we are explicitly NOT building now to protect the timeline and focus of this Epic.*
*   Creating custom roles is out of scope for this version.
*   Bulk-editing user roles will not be implemented.
*   ...

**(New) 5.3. Constraints**
*The mandatory boundaries and limitations we must work within.*
*   **Technical:** This feature must use the existing user authentication service and cannot require a new database. All UI components must be sourced from our established Design System.
*   **Business:** The core functionality must be launched before the Q3 sales kickoff on September 15th.
*   **Resource:** The project is allocated to 2 backend and 2 frontend engineers.

### 6. Open Questions & Risks

**6.1. Open Questions**
*A list of unresolved questions that need answers before or during development.*
*   What should the default role be for a newly invited user?
*   Is there a performance concern if an organization has over 10,000 users?

**6.2. Potential Risks**
*Potential problems that could threaten the project's success, and a plan to mitigate them.*
*   **Risk:** The upstream User Service API has no official performance SLOs.
    *   **Mitigation:** Meet with the User Service team to get performance commitments and add defensive client-side timeouts.
*   **Risk:** The design requires a complex data table component that may be difficult to build.
    *   **Mitigation:** The frontend team will build a technical prototype (a "spike") in the first week to validate the approach.
