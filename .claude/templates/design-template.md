# Design Overview
## 1. Goal
What is the primary technical objective of this document? What problem are we solving from an engineering perspective?

## 2. High-Level Architecture
* Include a system diagram (e.g., using Mermaid, Miro, or Lucidchart) showing how this new feature fits into the existing system. Show the services involved, data flow, and key interactions.
* list out each components and what are their purposes in the overall picture. For each component, it can has its own component design doc if it is big enough.

## 3. Detailed Design

### 3.1. **API Design (The Contract)**
    *   *Define the new or updated API endpoints. This is the contract between the frontend and backend.*
    > **Example:**
    > `POST /v1/playlists/{playlist_id}/collaborators`
    > *   **Description:** Invites a user to a playlist.
    > *   **Request Body:** `{ "userId": "string" }`
    > *   **Success Response:** `200 OK`
    > *   **Error Responses:** `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 NotFound`

### 3.2. **Database Design**
    *   *Describe any changes to the database schema. Include new tables, columns, indexes, and data migration plans.*
    > **Example:**
    > *   **New Table:** `playlist_collaborators`
    >     *   `playlist_id` (FK to `playlists.id`)
    >     *   `user_id` (FK to `users.id`)
    >     *   `role` (e.g., 'editor', 'viewer')
    >     *   `created_at`
    > *   **New Index:** Create a composite index on `(playlist_id, user_id)` for fast lookups.

### 3.3. **Backend Logic**
    *   *Describe the core logic, algorithms, and class/module structure for the backend implementation. This is the "how" of the business logic.*
    > *Example: "The `PlaylistService.addCollaborator` method will first validate that the requesting user is the owner of the playlist. It will then insert a new row into the `playlist_collaborators` table. Finally, it will enqueue a job in our notification queue to email the invited user."*

### 3.4. **Frontend Architecture**
    *   *Describe the approach for the client-side implementation. Mention new components, state management strategy, and data fetching.*
    > *Example: "A new React hook `usePlaylistCollaborators(playlistId)` will be created to fetch and cache collaborator data using React Query. A new `CollaboratorAvatarStack` component will be built to display the profile pictures of collaborators."*


## 4. Security Considerations
* Analyze potential security vulnerabilities and outline the mitigation strategy.
> Example:
> * Authorization: All API endpoints must verify that the requesting user is either the playlist owner or a registered collaborator before performing any action.
> * Input Sanitization: User-generated content (e.g., comments) will be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

## 5. Testing Strategy
* How will we ensure this feature is high-quality and bug-free?
> Example:
> * Unit Tests: The PlaylistService business logic will have >90% test coverage.
> * Integration Tests: We will write integration tests to verify the API endpoint correctly updates the database and calls the notification service.
> * End-to-End (E2E) Tests: QA will add a test case to the Cypress suite to simulate the full user flow of inviting a friend and adding a song.

## 6. Deployment & Monitoring
### 6.1. Deployment Plan
How will this be rolled out? Will it be behind a feature flag? Are there dependencies?
### 6.2. Monitoring & Alerts:
What key metrics will we monitor to ensure the feature is healthy? What alerts should be set up?*
