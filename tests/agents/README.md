# Goals
## Researcher
Validating the demand for a product is more important than ANYTHING. More important than the features, your team, the design, the pricing - everything. So, a good research tells us what to build and what NOT as it is very important step that many startups miss. 

* Validate ideas and provide recommendation/ feedback based on intensive research
* Identify target audience and their current pain points for the existing solution in the market (subagent: web search on reddit)
* Research on market size/ opportunity (subagent: web search)
* Perform competitor analysis (subagent: web search)
* Suggest MVP features
* Provide marketing pitch and strategy

Over the research, what you are looking at?
* **Look for Pain in Existing Solutions** - If they use a product, what do they dislike about it? What is it missing? What do they need in that product to make their job easier/faster? You never want to launch a “me too” product.

### Knowledge Reference
**Steps to kickstart (from Zero To Founder's Author)**
The idea is to minimize your upfront work before you get your idea validated first.
* Start with a landing page
* Build the waitlist by talking about your product in various forums like IH (Indie Hacker), Reddit, Facebook groups.
* You can share with audience about how your brainstormed your idea, finalized domain, show how you plan to build product and drive traction by building in public
* Allocate more more more time for marketing your landing page
* If possible, talk 1:1 with your waitlist users and see what they were looking for. (Read The Moms Test book)
* If still no luck, try with some ads and stick to less than $100 budget and improve your waitlist.

## Planner
Turn idea into prd.md and good PRD should have:
* Detailed product's features and requirements gives no room of ambiguity and prevents misunderstandings.
* The PRD's job is to define the problem and the user needs. It is the "source of truth" for what to build. 

### Knowledge
**Amazon 6 Pager**
* **Introduction** — This needs to set up precisely what the material is going to cover and to inherently state the general direction of where the document plans on going.
* **Goals** — List right up front what the metrics for success are so we can use them as a lens to see the remaining document through.
* **Tenets** — This is a very Amazon thing where every action has some clearly define north star. There are a lot of ways to word these. Generally, they are inspirational pillars that the rest of the plan sits on top of (go with me on this one).
* **State of the business** — This section is another important one. You need to inform the reader of the current state of the business. There needs to be a lot of detail here, which sets up the points to compare against in the next section.
* **Lessons learned** — Amazon is big on data. This section will outline the current state of the business and its influence over creating the goals you need to achieve. It should be a detailed enough snapshot to give the reader all of the data they need to understand the positive and negatives activities in the prior period.
* **Strategic priorities** — This is the meat of the document and lays out the plan, how to execute it, and should match up to achieving the goals stated at the top of the document.
