I want to build a modern web interface using ShadCN components.
Goal:
- A login page with standard email/password authentication.
- After login, a dashboard displays a grid of cards â€” each representing an MCP server.
- Clicking a card opens a detailed view with:
  - A header image
  - Metadata (name, status, region, version)
  - Installation steps shown as bubble cards or collapsible UI
Please generate an implementation plan:
- List the key components and pages to build
- Suggest how to structure the project modularly
- Recommend the tools/hooks/layout strategies to use for optimal UX
