# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a documentation and analysis workspace for Claude Code system prompts and tool descriptions. It contains analysis files that document Claude Code's behavior, system prompts, and tool specifications.

## Directory Structure

- `analysis/` - Contains documentation and analysis files for Claude Code
  - `system_prompt_main.md` - Main system prompt for Claude Code
  - `tools_*.md` - Individual tool descriptions and specifications
  - `cmd_*.md` - Command analysis documentation
  - `agent_analyzer_prompt.md` - Specialized agent analysis prompts

## Key Files

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Currently empty, intended for high-level architecture documentation
- Files in `analysis/` contain the core documentation for Claude Code's system behavior

## Development Tasks

This workspace is primarily for:
1. Maintaining and updating Claude Code system prompts
2. Documenting tool behaviors and specifications
3. Analyzing command implementations
4. Creating and maintaining Claude Code documentation

## Common Operations

- Edit system prompts: Modify files in `analysis/` directory
- Update tool descriptions: Edit corresponding `tools_*.md` files
- Document new commands: Create new `cmd_*.md` files in analysis/
- Review documentation: Read analysis files to understand Claude Code behavior

## File Types

- `.md` files: Markdown documentation and specifications
- No build/test commands needed - this is a documentation workspace
